# AutoFTARM

## Introduction
The purpose of this package is to enhance the existing FTARM (Fast Top-K Association Rule Miner) algorithm. Currently, the algorithm requires the user to input the minimum confidence level, and this package is meant to eliminate that step by computing the confidence level automatically.

## How to Install
While this package is still in development, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the working functions inside RStudio.
