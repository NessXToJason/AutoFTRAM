# AutoFTARM

## Introduction
The purpose of this package is to enhance the existing FTARM (Fast Top-K Association Rule Miner) algorithm. Currently, the algorithm requires the user to input the minimum confidence level, and this package is meant to eliminate that step by computing the confidence level automatically.
